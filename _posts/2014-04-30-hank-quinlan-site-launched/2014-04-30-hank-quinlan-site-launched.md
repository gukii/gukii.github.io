Trying to add a gallery automatically, with images stored in a local "images" folder within every post folder (named after the post, with date).

Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
